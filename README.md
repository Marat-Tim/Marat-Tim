üëÄ I am interested in:
- Backend development
- Machine learning
- Bots development
- Object-oriented programming
- And any other programming(but the previous points I like the most)

üéì I study at the Higher School of Economics(HSE), Faculty of Computer Science, software engineering, 3-rd year

‚úçÔ∏è In my free time, I like to listen to programming conferences or write small projects using technology unknown to me(to study it)

üê∏ Programming languages that I know:

<div>
   <div>
      <img style="float: left" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/java/java-original.svg" width="35px" alt="java"/>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>Java - I studied this language in the 2nd year of university, when I already had an understanding of how to write code good, so I know it best</p>
      <p>I know the basics of the language: syntax, standard library(collections, multithreading, annotations, stream api, etc.), popular libraries(serialization, testing, etc.) and build systems(maven, gradle)</p>
      <p>I have studied design patterns in this language, so I know them well in it</p>
      <p>I also know the Spring Boot framework. I know how it works, I know the basic annotations and I have experience in writing web services</p>
      <p>I know a little about android development in this language</p>
   </div>
</div>

   <div>
      <img style="float: left" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/csharp/csharp-original.svg" width="35px" alt="c-sharp"/>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>C++++++++++(C#) - I studied this language in the 1st year of university, when I didn't really know how to program. I really liked this language and I think it's better than Java</p>
      <p>I know the basics of this language: syntax, standard library(collections, multithreading, asynchronous, Linq, serialization, attributes, regex, etc.)</p>
      <p>I know frameworks for writing desktop applications, namely windows forms and WPF</p>
      <p>I know a little about the framework ASP.NET and developed the simplest web services on it</p>
      <p>I wrote bots for telegram and VKontakte in this language. My first course project is a bot for moderation of a board game</p>
   </div>

   <div>
      <img style="float: left" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg" width="35px" alt="python"/>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>Python - I have been studying this language constantly since school and use it in various fields. I like to use this language for scripts that will work 1 time and will not be used anymore. In my opinion, this language is not suitable for writing large programs, since there is no strict typing in it and I don't understand how OOP works in this language</p>
      <p>My knowledge in python:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Syntax, standard library</li>
         <li>Python for data analysis - I know the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn libraries</li>
         <li>Python for machine learning - I know the Scikit learn library</li>
         <li>Python for Mathematical sciences - I know the Sympy library, which is designed to work with derivatives, integrals, matrices and other mathematical objects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I often write small scripts in this language, for example, an excel spreadsheet concatenator, minecraft mod auto-translator :) and others</p>

   </div>
   <div>
      <p>c++ - I use this language mainly for writing algorithms and data structures. I know most of the syntax of this language, I know a little about the standard library (collections and algorithms). I don't know any frameworks in this language and never write normal projects on it</p>
   </div>

   </div>
   <div>
      <p>c - I studied this language in a course on linux and I can write in it only for this operating system. I know the syntax of the language and the standard library for linux(strings, multithreading, processes, TCP, UDP, file system). I haven't written normal projects in this language(I don't see the point of using it except for working with hardware)</p>

   <div>
      <img style="float: left" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/go/go-original.svg" width="35px" alt="go"/>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>Go - I started learning this language recently and at the moment I only know its syntax and pieces of the standard library. I liked this language and I think I will learn it at a normal level soon</p>
   </div>
</div>

üê∏ Other skills:

I know basic algorithms and data structures, design patterns (GoF), architectural patterns (MVC, MVP, MVVM). I have experience with Linux console (I know bash). I understand HTTP, TCP, UDP protocol. I know the principles of REST. I know how to use git. I know a little about sql(postgres). I use Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio Drawing; Google docs, sheets, forms. I know how to create and work with virtual machines. I love and use Jetbrains IDE. For C#, I prefer to use Visual Studio + Resharper. I also know how to use Jupyter Notebook. I am not afraid of mathematics, I won Olympiads in it at school, and at university I knew linear algebra, mathematical analysis and discrete mathematics at a normal level. I use chatGPT and analogs
