- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am @Marat-Tim. I am 18 years old and I want to become a programmer. I study at the "Higher School of Economics", Faculty of Computer Science, areas of training - software engineering.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in programming and mathematics. 
- ðŸŒ± Programming languages that I know(in descending order of knowledge about them):
1. C+++++++++++(C#) - I studied this language in my first year of university and in fact this is my first serious language. I can write console applications(for example, simplified file system or matrix calculator), windows forms applications(simplified text editor), wpf applications(fractals painter) and "web-API ASP.NET Core" applications(the simplest program). I like to write code on this language.
2. Python - I learn bases of this language at school. At university I studied different libraries: pandas, sympy, matplotlib(know badly). I like to write little scripts on python(for example, auto-translator minecraft mods or excel file combiner). Also I can get information from datasets but I can't analyze it.
3. Ð¡++ - I know only bases of this language. For example, I can write code for two - linked list, but I don't write normal projects. 
4. Pascal ABC - I know a little about this language.

      Also, I have good mark on linear algebra. I know LU, QR, SVD matrix decomposition and I understand Diffieâ€“Hellman protocol.
